WordChecker
===========

sample program to check if word is in dictionary

This is just a small program in python. It uses the linux dictionary and simply scans it to find the entered word.

I run the script in python3 on a linux Mint virtual machine, so it wont work on windows.

Pretty much just mucking around in python. I really like this language as its very intuitive. I hope to come back and write 
some more fun programs in python eventually.
